## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For Deployment
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) \* Used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) \* Used to store the code once pushed from Git.

### What I learned

This was my third project using React, and my second using Tailwind. I learnt and understood how to structure the code and seperate components into there own files that will interact with each other. I started to get a further grasp of props and state, particlary how to lift state up to a parent component so its able to be used by the whole app and not just restricted to a single component.

### Continued development

Contiue to cement the fundamentals of react while building a more real world project
